County,"Name of the county in which the water body is within. An individual water body can cross more than one county, so multiple counties may be listed. Additionally, in order to adhere to a unique ID a county name may be different than the associated GPS location if a water body crosses multiple counties and/or states.","County names were supplied by agencies collecting the data, or added to water body locations using a spatial merge process within ArcGIS using census data from 2010 for the county spatial layer (http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger)."

Location,Description of boat ramp location where available.,"Various sources from state, federal, provincial and local governing agencies."
ID,"A unique identifier code created for the water body. Unique ID was typically made up of the Water body_First four letters of the county name_state abbreviation.
